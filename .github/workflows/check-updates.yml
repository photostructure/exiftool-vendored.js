          # Use GITHUB_TOKEN for signed commits (like the working exiftool-vendored.pl workflow)
          # This allows automatic GitHub signing and you can approve PRs created by github-actions[bot]

          # NOTE: We tried using a PAT to trigger CI workflows automatically,
          # but hit issues with signed commits and self-approval restrictions. The trade-offs:

          # GITHUB_TOKEN (current):
          # ✅ Works with signed commit requirements
          # ✅ You can approve PRs (created by github-actions[bot], not you)
          # ❌ CI workflows don't auto-trigger (must manually trigger if needed)

          # PAT approach:
          # ✅ CI workflows auto-trigger
          # ❌ Can't approve your own PRs (PAT owner becomes author)
          # ❌ Bot accounts require signed commit setups

          # Conclusion: GITHUB_TOKEN is simpler and more reliable for this use
          # case. We lose automatic CI triggering, but at least it works.
