          # Use bot account PAT instead of GITHUB_TOKEN to allow CI workflows to trigger on the created PR

          # Additionally, using a bot account allows the repo owner to approve PRs (can't approve your own PRs)
          # 
          # Setup required:
          # 1. Create a dedicated bot GitHub account (e.g., 'yourname-bot')
          # 2. Add bot as repository collaborator with "Write" role (not just write access)
          # 3. Create PAT on bot account with 'repo' scope (classic PAT recommended)
          # 4. Store bot's PAT as DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_PAT repository secret

          # Note: Bot must have "Write" role, not just write access to specific files
